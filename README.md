## Study Questions (3 points x 4 = 12 points)

### Q1. (3 points)

www1, www2, and ww3 are mirrors for server load balancing, so that the pages can be hosted on different servers.

### Q2. (3 points)

status=200 means that the page was queried and returned successfuly, which is necessary because otherwise we would query pages that didn't return correctly

### Q3. (3 points)

So that you may do many different steps of commands, and be able to chip and chip until you get the right set of data that you want.

### Q4. (3 points)

Doing database entries like that can take a lot of server time and make our clients experience worse by making it slower and you can do more complex queries after the fact.
